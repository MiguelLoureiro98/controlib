# API Reference

This is the API reference for the ControLib library.

If you are looking for the documentation of a specific class or function, you will find it here.

Each page is entirely dedicated to either a module or a class, and provides a brief descriptive summary of every function and class, parameter lists, and useful examples.

Modules and subpackages will be listed and described here as the package grows.
